      My love of programming started at an early age. In third grade, my
      friend Sam and I tried to memorize the alphabet in binary out of a
      Farmersâ€™ Almanac (we were sure it would come in handy).
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, I learned how variables, loops, and other basic (or BASIC
      ðŸ˜‰) programming concepts from a Windows 95 game by Interplay
      called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/uBYz9syhNAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        &lsquo;Learn to Program BASIC&lsquo;.
      </a>
      I would carry around a notebook to scribble JavaScript in to try
      out when I got home from school (and make cool cursor trails on my
      MySpace page).
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the next two decades as what I would call a &lsquo;hobby
      technologist&lsquo;, experimenting with gadgets and gizmos,
      building automations using exisiting tooling. I persued careers in
      music and restaurants before coming back to relearn programming
      and finding my way into the industry.

      Today, I build full-stack web applications using a variety of
      technologies, mostly centered around the .NET and Typescript
      ecosystems with an emphasis on embracing modern web APIs. I&apos;m
      a contributor to open source projects such as
      <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a> and
      <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedwoodJS</a>, and
      love sharing what I&apos;ve learned by speaking at local meetups
      and conferences such as
      <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rva-js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RVA.js</a>
      and
      <a href="https://rvasdug.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RVASDUG</a>.
